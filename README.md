Hello all, "The Larch" is my first blogging site, and unfortunately, 
the website is not responsive to mobile and tablet screen but only desktop screen which is not cool.
I am myself working on making the site viewable for all the screens.

Feel free guys to contribute and help this newbie make his blogging site awesome for all the devices.
